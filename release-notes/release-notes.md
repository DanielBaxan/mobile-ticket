<h3>Upgrade Instructions</h3>
- When upgrading from a previous version, following should be considered.

1. 'otp_service' parameter needs to be added to config.json

```
"otp_service": {
    "value": "enable",
    "description": "Enable or disable OTP service"
  }
```
2. 'tenand_id' parameter needs to be configured in mt-service/src/config/config.json
```
  "tenant_id": {
    "value": "1001",
    "description": "unique identifire of the client application"
  }
```
3. 'db_connection_string' parameter needs to be configured in mt-service/src/config/config.json
```
  "db_connection_string": {
    "value": "",
    "description": "database connection URL"
  }
```
OTP feature needs a valid MongoDB database and the connection string needs to be provided for the "db_connection_string" parameter as mentioned above. The database can setup as a local MongoDB database, a MongoDB hosted on a cloud like AWS (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/quickstart/latest/mongodb/welcome.html), a global cloud database service like Atlas (https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas), or can be run as a docker container. Please read the deployment guide for more information regarding this.
